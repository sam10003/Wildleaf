#json structure planning

first off we need an official list of what plants are considered
endangered currently and for so will appear in our queries

the IUCN is the so called gold standard, an AUTHORITY in biology
and so we will build on that

#oh but sam i dont like biology
yk i got a 10 back first of ESO, imagine

to grab the data from the IUCN we need to study a slight bit
categories in which species can be classified:

(EX) Extinct
meaning: no reasonable doubt the last individual has infact died
which means no conservation action can save them

(EW) Extinct in the Wild
meaning: only survives in captivity human-controlled environments

(CR) Critically Endangered
meaning: extremely high risk of extinction in the wild very soon
normally 80-90% over the last 10 years or 3 generations, or just simply
extremely small population

(EN) Endangered
meaning: high risk of extinction in the near future
50-70% reduction over the last 10 years or 3 generations

(VU) Vulnerable
meaning: high risk of extinction in the medium term, population
reduction 30-50% over the last 10 years or 3 generations,
meaning it needs monitoring and conservation of some sorts

(NT) Near Threatened
meaning: close to qualifiying as threatened but not quite yet, if trends 
continue it could become vulnerable

(LC) Least concern
meaning: chill

(DD) Data deficient

(NE) Not evaluated

alright thats enough biology
the IUCN will prvovide us a list the which will for now basically 
decide the species that we wlll use for this

lets then research, what api functions or how we would even obtain
